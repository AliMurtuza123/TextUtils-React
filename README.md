TextUtil is a react-based single-page web application. 
It is a text utility app where one can transform his/her text. 
One can convert the text into uppercase, or lowercase, add capitalization, copy the text on the clipboard, remove extra spaces, and finally clear the whole text. 
Apart from doing mentioned things, it automatically counts the words, characters, and the approximate time to read the text.
It can be beneficial for the professionals like digital marketers.
I have used HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and react to create this application.
This application fully works with javascript and doesn't need any backend.
I have hosted this application on GitHub Pages using the Hashed method as GitHub pages don't support the non-hashed method.
